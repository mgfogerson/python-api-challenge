In this challenge, I first set about creating a list of randomly generated, evenly distributed GPS coordinates and used the Citipy module to connect these coordinates to cities around the world. After collecting a list of over 700 cities, I used the OpenWeather API to retrieve sets of weather data, which I correlated to the latitude of the city. Using Matplotlib, it was easy to map out the correlation strengths that different weather features have to latitude. For instance, although temperature rose significantly approaching the equator, there was far less correlation with wind speeds or cloudiness in relation to latitude. 

After completing the Weatherpy challenge, I began the VacationPy challenge, using the list of cities generated in the last activity. This list was used to create a heat map of humidity across the globe, measuring each city's humidity to map out an ideal vacation spot. Taking this idea further, the list of cities was whittled down to a small few by controlling for the most ideal weather for a vacation. After this was completed, I used the cities' existing GPS coordinates along with the Google Places API to generate the closest hotel to my remaining cities. Using Jupyter's gmaps function, I mapped these hotels to the humidity heat map, along with pins that contained the hotel name, city and country. This challenge gave me a good look at collecting data to be used and reducing it down to the most relevant information, and then applying the API lessons to explore a visual mapping of the information.
